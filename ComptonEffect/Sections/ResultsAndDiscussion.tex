	\subsection{Discussion Of Results}
	
	\subsection{Discussion Of Errors}
		Although some error was present in the measurement, the results were clear enough to draw concrete conclusions. Especially after the smoothing done by the software of the MCA, errors were less prominent.
	
		\subsubsection{Main Sources Of Errors}
			The main sources of error in this experiment are:
				\paragraph{Angle Arrangement}
				
				\paragraph{Shielding}
		
		\subsubsection{Error Mitigation}
